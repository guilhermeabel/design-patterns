# design-patterns in PHP, Java, and C#
## Examples of design patterns for reference and learning purposes.

This repository contains examples of design patterns implemented in multiple programming languages.
- Each folder represents a different programming language (PHP, Java, C#) and includes implementations of various design patterns such as singleton, bridge, facade, and more. 
- These examples serve as a reference for developers who are looking to learn more about design patterns and how they can be implemented in different languages. 
- Each implementation includes code examples and explanations of how the pattern works.
